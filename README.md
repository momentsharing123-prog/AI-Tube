# AI-Tube

> **This project is a fork of [MyTube](https://github.com/franklioxygen/MyTube) by [franklioxygen](https://github.com/franklioxygen).** All original credit goes to the upstream author. This fork adds MP3/MP4 format selection, a token-based REST API for AI agent integration, and a local Docker Compose setup for personal self-hosting.

Self-hosted downloader and player for YouTube, Bilibili, Twitch, MissAV, and [yt-dlp sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md). Features channel subscriptions, auto-downloads, and local storage for media. Organize your library into collections with a sleek UI. Includes built-in Cloudflare Tunnel support for secure remote access without port forwarding. Docker-ready deployment.

🚀 100% Prompt-Engineered. 0 Lines of Manual Code.

## Features

- **Video Downloading**: Download YouTube, Bilibili, Twitch, MissAV and other yt-dlp-supported videos with a simple URL input.
- **Video Upload**: Upload local video files directly to your library with automatic thumbnail generation.
- **TMDB Metadata Scraping**: Automatically scrape movie and TV show metadata (title, description, poster, director, year, rating) from TMDB based on filename. Supports localized content matching your site language.
- **Parallel Downloads**: Queue multiple downloads and track their progress simultaneously.
- **Batch Download**: Add multiple video URLs at once to the download queue.
- **Concurrent Download Limit**: Set a limit on the number of simultaneous downloads to manage bandwidth.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Automatically upload videos and thumbnails to cloud storage (OpenList/Alist) after download.
- **Auto Subtitles**: Automatically download YouTube / Bilibili default language subtitles.
- **Collections**: Organize videos into custom collections for easy access.
- **Subscriptions**: Manage YouTube, Bilibili and Twitch channel subscriptions to automatically download new content.
- **Login Protection**: Secure your application with password login and optional passkeys (WebAuthn).
- **Visitor User**: Enable a read-only role for safe sharing without modification capabilities.
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages including English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian.
- **Mobile Optimizations**: Mobile-friendly tags menu and optimized layout for smaller screens.
- **Cookie Management**: Support for uploading `cookies.txt` to enable downloading of age-restricted or premium content.
- **yt-dlp Configuration**: Customize global `yt-dlp` arguments, network proxy, and other advanced settings via settings page.
- **TMDB Integration**: Configure your TMDB API key in settings to enable automatic metadata scraping for local video files. The scraper intelligently parses filenames to extract titles and matches them with TMDB database.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**: Built-in Cloudflare Tunnel support to easily expose your local MyTube instance to the internet without port forwarding.
- **Task Hooks**: Execute custom shell scripts at various stages of a download task (start, success, fail, cancel) for integration and automation. See [Task Hooks Guide](documents/en/hooks-guide.md).
- **Telegram Notifications**: Receive instant notifications via Telegram bot when a download task succeeds or fails.
- **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension to download videos directly from your browser. Supports all yt-dlp supported sites.

## AI Agent Skill (Claude Code)

AI-Tube ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skill that lets you trigger downloads by chatting with your AI agent — no browser required.

### Install the skill

Copy the skill into your Claude Code global skills folder:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/mytube-download
cp .claude/skills/mytube-download/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/mytube-download/SKILL.md

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\mytube-download"
Copy-Item ".claude\skills\mytube-download\SKILL.md" "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\mytube-download\SKILL.md"
```

### Enable the API

Set these environment variables before starting the container (see [docker/docker-compose.local.yml](docker/docker-compose.local.yml)):

```env
MYTUBE_API_ENABLED=true
MYTUBE_API_TOKEN=        # leave blank to auto-generate a token on first start
```

On first start, the generated token is printed to the container log:

```bash
docker logs mytube-api | grep "API access key"
```

### Use the skill

In Claude Code, type:

```
/mytube-download  download https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx as mp3
```

The skill will:
1. Load (or prompt for) your API token and save it to `~/.mytube-token`
2. Verify the token against the running container
3. Submit the download job via the REST API
4. Report back the download ID and let you poll progress on demand

### Supported formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mp4`  | Best quality video + audio |
| `mp3`  | Audio only, highest quality |

For full REST API documentation see [API Reference](documents/en/api.md).

## API Endpoints

For a list of available API endpoints, please refer to [API Endpoints](documents/en/api-endpoints.md).

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Database)

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with React Query

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Storage Service**: Split into focused modules for maintainability
- **Downloader Pattern**: Abstract base class for platform-specific implementations
- **Database Migrations**: Automatic schema updates using Drizzle Kit
- **Download Queue Management**: Concurrent downloads with queue support
- **Video Download Tracking**: Prevents duplicate downloads across sessions

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
VITE_BACKEND_URL=
```

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
PORT=5551
# Optional: declare the admin trust boundary for this deployment.
# Valid values: application | container | host
# Default: container
# MYTUBE_ADMIN_TRUST_LEVEL=container
```

Data and uploads are stored under `backend/data` and `backend/uploads` by default (relative to the backend working directory).

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and adjust as needed. The frontend ships with `frontend/.env`; use `frontend/.env.local` to override defaults.

## Database

MyTube uses **SQLite** with **Drizzle ORM** for data persistence. The database is automatically created and migrated on first startup:

- **Location**: `backend/data/mytube.db`
- **Migrations**: Automatically run on server startup
- **Schema**: Managed through Drizzle Kit migrations
- **Legacy Support**: Migration tools available to convert from JSON-based storage

Key database tables:

- `videos`: Video metadata and file paths
- `collections`: Video collections/playlists
- `subscriptions`: Channel/creator subscriptions
- `downloads`: Active download queue
- `download_history`: Completed download history
- `video_downloads`: Tracks downloaded videos to prevent duplicates
- `settings`: Application configuration
