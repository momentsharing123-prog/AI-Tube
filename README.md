# AI-Tube

> **This project is a fork of [MyTube](https://github.com/franklioxygen/MyTube) by [franklioxygen](https://github.com/franklioxygen).** All original credit goes to the upstream author. This fork adds MP3/MP4 format selection, a token-based REST API for AI agent integration, and a local Docker Compose setup for personal self-hosting.

Self-hosted downloader and player for YouTube, Bilibili, Twitch, MissAV, and [yt-dlp sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md). Features channel subscriptions, auto-downloads, and local storage for media. Organize your library into collections with a sleek UI. Includes built-in Cloudflare Tunnel support for secure remote access without port forwarding. Docker-ready deployment.

🚀 100% Prompt-Engineered. 0 Lines of Manual Code.

## AI Agent Skill (Claude Code)

AI-Tube ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skill so you can trigger downloads by chatting with your AI agent — no browser required.

### Install

Copy the entire skill folder into your Claude Code global skills directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp -r .claude/skills/aitube-download ~/.claude/skills/aitube-download
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item -Recurse ".claude\skills\aitube-download" "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\aitube-download"
```

Then fill in your server details in the token files:

```
~/.claude/skills/aitube-download/token/aitube-url    ← e.g. http://localhost:6001
~/.claude/skills/aitube-download/token/aitube-token  ← your API key
```

Get your API key from the container log:

```bash
docker logs ai-tube-prod | grep "API access key"
```

> The `token/` folder ships with empty placeholder files. Your personal values are excluded from git via a `.gitignore` inside that folder.

### Enable the API

Set these in your Docker Compose env before starting (see [docker/docker-compose.local.yml](docker/docker-compose.local.yml)):

```env
AITUBE_API_ENABLED=true
AITUBE_API_TOKEN=        # leave blank to auto-generate on first start
```

### Sample Conversations

Once the skill is installed, invoke it from Claude Code chat:

- **Parallel Downloads**: Queue multiple downloads and track their progress simultaneously.
- **Batch Download**: Add multiple video URLs at once to the download queue.
- **Concurrent Download Limit**: Set a limit on the number of simultaneous downloads to manage bandwidth.

## Getting Started

For installation and setup instructions, please refer to [Getting Started](documents/en/getting-started.md).

## Deployment Security Model

For the three-tier admin trust and deployment security model, please refer to [Deployment Security Model](documents/en/deployment-security-model.md).

## API Endpoints

For a list of available API endpoints, please refer to [API Endpoints](documents/en/api-endpoints.md).

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Database)

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with React Query

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Storage Service**: Split into focused modules for maintainability
- **Downloader Pattern**: Abstract base class for platform-specific implementations
- **Database Migrations**: Automatic schema updates using Drizzle Kit
- **Download Queue Management**: Concurrent downloads with queue support
- **Video Download Tracking**: Prevents duplicate downloads across sessions

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
VITE_BACKEND_URL=
```

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
PORT=5551
# Optional: declare the admin trust boundary for this deployment.
# Valid values: application | container | host
# Default: container
# AITUBE_ADMIN_TRUST_LEVEL=container
```

Data and uploads are stored under `backend/data` and `backend/uploads` by default (relative to the backend working directory).

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and adjust as needed. The frontend ships with `frontend/.env`; use `frontend/.env.local` to override defaults.

## Database

AI Tube uses **SQLite** with **Drizzle ORM** for data persistence. The database is automatically created and migrated on first startup:

- **Location**: `backend/data/aitube.db`
- **Migrations**: Automatically run on server startup
- **Schema**: Managed through Drizzle Kit migrations
- **Legacy Support**: Migration tools available to convert from JSON-based storage

Key database tables:

- `videos`: Video metadata and file paths
- `collections`: Video collections/playlists
- `subscriptions`: Channel/creator subscriptions
- `downloads`: Active download queue
- `download_history`: Completed download history
- `video_downloads`: Tracks downloaded videos to prevent duplicates
- `settings`: Application configuration
